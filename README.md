# Collaborative work for Database Management Systems
<br>Project code name: StoneWoodBooks
<br>Programmers: Devin Laterza, Wesley Phelps

<br>Everything in the admin pages were made by Devin
<br>Most of the things that are seen in the Customer pages (including the Regex and the dynamic buttons) were made by me
<br>Might seem a little unfinished, but every other group had 1 extra group member more than us.
